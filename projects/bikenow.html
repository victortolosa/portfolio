<p>It all started on a hazy monday morning with the question "Should I Bike Today?". That question sparked an idea that eventually became Bike Now.</p>
<p> The problem was that most weather forecast websites are too cluttered and took too long to find out if it was suitable weather to bike. Can I bike now? How about if I'm still biking in two hours? six?. Will the sun be down by the time I need to bike home? </p>

<p> My solution was to aggragate all the essential weather data relevant to biking and put it in a quick, simple, easy interface.</p>
<p> This was my first foray into PHP and it was pretty fun experience working with a server-side language. For the front-end I tried to make it as simple as possible yet fully responsive.</p>
