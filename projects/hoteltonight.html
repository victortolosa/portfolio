	<p>The 4 months I spent interning at HotelTonight brought on a variety of different challenges and accomplishments. For this case study I would like to focus on a particular aspect of the new iteration of HotelTonight I worked on.</p>

	<h1> Iteration Is King </h1>
	<p>At the early stages of ideation it was important to not fall in love with my first idea. I needed a second, third, fourth... as many as I felt necessary. Which ones work better and why? When I started sketching possible designs, conflicts began to show themselves. Each solution is valid, but which one is ideal for our users? Questioning designs and iterating on them solved for hidden pain points and allowed ideas to branch off into spaces I wouldn't have originally.</p>

	<h1> Vetting Concepts Through User Stories </h1>
	<p>
	Creating personas and user stories helped vet many of my original designs. There's making something look nice, and theres making something functional and intuitive. The challenge is having the best of both worlds. Running all my designs through possible use cases allowed me to understand our users and design an interface that suits their needs.

	<h1>Adopting Native Design Patterns </h1>
	<p>A lot of designer's love apple. It's a generalization there's no getting away from. That doesn't mean Android shouldn't get any love. It's important to design for different platforms thoughtfully. Bringing over iOS design patterns onto an android app or vice versa is just bad form. Making sure the design was carefully adopted into the Android platform was essential.</p>

	<h1>Prototyping &amp; User Testing</h1>
	<p>Testing an interface through user stories and flows are not enough, it's all risky assumptions until you get it in front of a user. With user testing my designs I was able to recognize pain points and flaws I couldn't see myself. </p>
